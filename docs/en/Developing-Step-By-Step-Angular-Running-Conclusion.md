# Conclusion

In this document, we built a complete example that covers most parts of
the ASP.NET Zero system. We hope that it will help you to build your own
application.

We intentionally used different approaches for similar tasks to show you
different styles of development. ASP.NET Zero provides an architecture
but does not restrict you. You can make your own style development.



## Code Generation

Using new **ASP.NET Zero Power Tools**, you can speed up your development.

See [documentation](https://aspnetzero.com/Documents/Development-Guide-Rad-Tool) to learn how to use it.
