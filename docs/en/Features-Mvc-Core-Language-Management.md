# Language Management

Language management page is used to manage (add/edit/delete) **application languages** and change **localized texts**:

We can create new language, edit/delete an existing language and **set a language as default**. Note that; tenants can not edit/delete default languages, but host users can do.

When we click to **Change text** for any language, we are redirected to a new view to edit language texts:

We can select any language as a **base** (reference) and change **target** language's texts. Base language is just to help the translation progress. Since there maybe different [localization sources](https://aspnetboilerplate.com/Pages/Documents/Localization#DocLocalizationSources), we select the source to translate. When we click the edit icon, we can see the edit modal for the selected text:

**Host** users (if allowed) can edit languages and localized texts. These languages will be default for all tenants for a multi-tenant application. **Tenants** inherit languages and localized texts and can **override** localized texts or can add new languages. 

Both pages use **LanguageAppService** class as application service. It has methods to manage languages and localized texts. **IApplicationLanguageManager** and **IApplicationLanguageTextManager**
interfaces are used to perform domain logic (as used by LanguageAppService).

If you want to add a new language, you can review the documentation on [How to Add a New Language in an ASP.NET Zero MVC Application](Adding-New-Localization-Mvc)

See [language management](https://aspnetboilerplate.com/Pages/Documents/Zero/Language-Management) and [localization](https://aspnetboilerplate.com/Pages/Documents/Localization) documents for more information.
