# QR Login Integration in ASP.NET Zero with MAUI

## Introduction
QR Login has been integrated into ASP.NET Zero, allowing users to log in to the web application by scanning a QR code from the MAUI application. This document explains how to enable and use QR Login in ASP.NET Zero with MAUI.

## Enabling QR Login
Before you can use the QR Login functionality, it needs to be enabled in the ASP.NET Zero web application settings. Follow these steps to enable QR Login:

1. Navigate to **Settings** in the ASP.NET Zero Web application.
2. Go to the **User Management** tab, locate the **QR Login** setting, and enable it.
3. Save the settings.

Once enabled, the login page on the web application will display a QR code for authentication.

> **Note:** After enabling QR Login on the Host Settings page, each tenant can independently enable or disable the QR Login feature in their specific tenant settings.

1. Open the **MAUI application** and log in.
2. Navigate to the **Sidebar Menu**.
3. Select **QR Login** from the menu.
4. If you haven't granted camera permission before, allow access to the camera.
5. The QR Code Reader will activate.
