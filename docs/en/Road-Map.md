We are constantly getting feedbacks from our customers to improve ASP.NET Zero. Here, **some** of the features will be implemented in the next versions:


-   Power Tools enhancements
-   User Sync/Link feature
-   Tenant login page customization
-   Orderable menu items
-   Code Analysis Rules
-   Coupon for Subscriptions
-   Send error messages via email
-   PayPal recurring payments.
-   Improvements on current features
-   More tutorials, examples & video courses

We are adding new items here as we clarify them. All these features and
**much more** will be available also for current customers in their
upgrade period.

Notes:

- Major features are only being developed for ASP.NET Core + jQuery
  and ASP.NET Core + Angular versions beginning from v4.1. See
  [version comparison table](Version-Differences.md) for more.
- The items on road map are subject to change based on customer
  feedbacks and our internal decisions.
