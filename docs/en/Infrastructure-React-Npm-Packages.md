# NPM Packages

ASP.NET Zero solution supports both [Yarn v1.x](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) to obtain front end library dependencies (like React and Bootstrap). We suggest to use yarn because NPM has some problems, yarn solves those problems and it is compatible with NPM as well. You can easily add, update or remove packages on yarn's command line interface.
