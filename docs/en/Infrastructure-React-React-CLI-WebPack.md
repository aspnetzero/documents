# React toolchain & WebPack

ASP.NET Zero uses [React-cli](https://cli.React.io/) for the
development and deployment. It's properly configured for React-cli and
already working. To run the application, open command line and type
"**npm start**" command (or "npm run hmr" to enable hot module
replacement feature). Once it's compiled and ready, you can go to
<http://localhost:4200> to open the application in your browser. See
[React-cli](https://cli.React.io/) official web site for more.
