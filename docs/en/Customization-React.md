## Customization

### Changing Logos

The default template has 5 main logos and they are located in `public/assets/common/images/`:

1. `app-logo-on-dark.svg` - Full logo for dark backgrounds
2. `app-logo-on-dark-sm.svg` - Small logo for dark backgrounds
3. `app-logo-on-light.svg` - Full logo for light backgrounds
4. `app-logo-on-light-sm.svg` - Small logo for light backgrounds
5. `logo.svg` - General purpose logo

**Naming convention:**

- `*-dark*` versions are used on **dark backgrounds** (light-colored themes use these)
- `*-light*` versions are used on **light backgrounds** (dark-colored themes use these)
- `*-sm.svg` versions are smaller variants used in footers or collapsed sidebars

**Additional variants:**

The project also includes alternative logo versions (`app-logo-on-dark-2.svg`, `app-logo-on-dark-sm-2.svg`) that can be used for different branding scenarios.
