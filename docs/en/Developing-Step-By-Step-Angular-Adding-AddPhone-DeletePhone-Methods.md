# Adding AddPhone and DeletePhone Methods

We are adding two more methods to IPersonAppService interface as shown
below:

```csharp
Task DeletePhone(EntityDto<long> input);
Task<PhoneInPersonListDto> AddPhone(AddPhoneInput input);
```

We could create a new, separated IPhoneAppService. It's your choice.
But, we can consider Person as an aggregate and add phone related
methods here. AddPhoneInput DTO is shown below:

```csharp
public class AddPhoneInput
{
    [Range(1, int.MaxValue)]
    public int PersonId { get; set; }

    [Required]
    public PhoneType Type { get; set; }

    [Required]
    [MaxLength(PhoneConsts.MaxNumberLength)]
    public string Number { get; set; }
}
```

We used PhoneConsts.MaxNumberLength for Number field. You should create
this consts in **.Core.Shared**.

```csharp
public class PhoneConsts
{
    public const int MaxNumberLength = 16;
}
```

Now, we can implement these methods:

```csharp
[AbpAuthorize(AppPermissions.Pages_Tenant_PhoneBook_EditPerson)]
public async Task DeletePhone(EntityDto<long> input)
{
    await _phoneRepository.DeleteAsync(input.Id);
}

[AbpAuthorize(AppPermissions.Pages_Tenant_PhoneBook_EditPerson)]
public async Task<PhoneInPersonListDto> AddPhone(AddPhoneInput input)
{
    var person = _personRepository.Get(input.PersonId);
    await _personRepository.EnsureCollectionLoadedAsync(person, p => p.Phones);

    var phone = ObjectMapper.Map<Phone>(input);
    person.Phones.Add(phone);

    //Get auto increment Id of the new Phone by saving to database
    await CurrentUnitOfWork.SaveChangesAsync();

    return ObjectMapper.Map<PhoneInPersonListDto>(phone);
}
```

Then we add configuration for AutoMapper into CustomDtoMapper.cs like below:

```csharp
configuration.CreateMap<AddPhoneInput, Phone>();
```

A permission should have a unique name. We define permission names as constant strings in **AppPermissions** class. It's a simple constant string:

```csharp
public const string Pages_Tenant_PhoneBook_DeletePhone = "Pages.Tenant.DeletePhone";
public const string Pages_Tenant_PhoneBook_AddPhone = "Pages.Tenant.AddPhone";
```

Go to **AppAuthorizationProvider** class in the server side and add a new permission as shown below (you can add just below the dashboard permission):

```csharp
phoneBook.CreateChildPermission(AppPermissions.Pages_Tenant_PhoneBook_DeletePhone, L("DeletePhone"), multiTenancySides: MultiTenancySides.Tenant);
phoneBook.CreateChildPermission(AppPermissions.Pages_Tenant_PhoneBook_AddPhone, L("AddPhone"), multiTenancySides: MultiTenancySides.Tenant);
```

(Note: We injected **IRepository&lt;Phone, long&gt;** in the constructor
and set to \_phoneRepository field, as similar to \_personRepository)

**DeletePhone** method is simple. It only deletes phone with given id.

**AddPhone** method **gets** the person from database and add new phone
to person.Phones collection. Then is **save changes**. Saving changes
causes inserting new added phone to database and get its **Id**.
Because, we are returning a DTO that contains newly created phone
informations including Id. So, it should be assigned before mapping in
the last line. (Notice that; normally it's not needed to call
CurrentUnitOfWork.SaveChangesAsync. It's automatically called at the end
of the method. We called it in the method since we need to save entity
and get its Id immediately. See [UOW
document](https://aspnetboilerplate.com/Pages/Documents/Unit-Of-Work#DocAutoSaveChanges)
for more.)

There may be different approaches for AddPhone method. You can directly
work with a **phone repository** to insert new phone. They all have
different pros and cons. It's your choice.
