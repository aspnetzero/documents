# Creating Person Entity

We define entities in **.Core** (domain) project (in server side). We
can define a **Person** entity (mapped to **PbPersons** table in
database) to represent a person in phone book as shown below (I created
in a new folder/namespace named PhoneBook):

```csharp
using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations;
using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.Schema;
using Abp.Domain.Entities.Auditing;

namespace Acme.PhoneBookDemo.PhoneBook;

[Table("PbPersons")]
    public class Person : FullAuditedEntity
    {
        public const int MaxNameLength = 32;
        public const int MaxSurnameLength = 32;
        public const int MaxEmailAddressLength = 255;

        [Required]
        [MaxLength(MaxNameLength)]
        public virtual string Name { get; set; }

        [Required]
        [MaxLength(MaxSurnameLength)]
        public virtual string Surname { get; set; }

        [MaxLength(MaxEmailAddressLength)]
        public virtual string EmailAddress { get; set; }
    }
```

Person's **primary key** type is **int** (as default). It inherits
**FullAuditedEntity** that contains **creation**, **modification** and
**deletion** audit properties. It's also **soft-delete**. When we delete
a person, it's not deleted by database but marked as deleted (see
[entity](https://aspnetboilerplate.com/Pages/Documents/Entities) and
[data
filters](https://aspnetboilerplate.com/Pages/Documents/Data-Filters)
documentations for more information). We created consts for
**MaxLength** properties. This is a good practice since we will use same
values later.

We add a DbSet property for Person entity to **PhoneBookDemoDbContext**
class defined in **.EntityFrameworkCore** project.

```csharp
public class PhoneBookDemoDbContext : AbpZeroDbContext<Tenant, Role, User, PhoneBookDemoDbContext>
{
    public virtual DbSet<Person> Persons { get; set; }

    //...other code
}
```
