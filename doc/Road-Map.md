We are constantly getting feedbacks from our customers to improve our
product. Here, **some** of the features will be implemented in next
versions:

-   **RAD** (Rapid Application Development) tooling.
-   Tenant **subscription enhancements** (like recurring payments).
-   Sending **mass notifications/emails** to users.
-   **Calendar** module.
-   Session timeout & **lock screen**.
-   Enhancements on **public web site** (like newsletter and contact
    pages).
-   **Improvements** on current features.
-   More **tutorials** and **examples**.

We are adding new items here as we clearify them. All these features and
**much more** will be available also for current customers in their
upgrade period.

Notes:

-    Major features are only being developed for ASP.NET Core + jQuery
    and ASP.NET Core + Angular versions beginning from v4.1. See
    [version comparison table](Version-Differences.md) for more.
-   The items on road map are subject to change based on customer
    feedbacks and our internal decisions.
