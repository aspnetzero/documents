# Using ASP.NET Zero with DevExtreme Angular Part 4

The ASP.NET Zero framework provides a robust foundation for building web applications with Angular and ASP.NET Core. In this blog post series, we explore the integration of ASP.NET Zero with DevExtreme Angular, a powerful UI component library.

In the last part of the series, we focus on implementing the **editing** functionality in the phone book application. We start by adding a `EditPerson` method to the server-side application service, `IPersonAppService`, and define the necessary DTO (Data Transfer Object) to transfer person information.

With these steps completed, we enhance the phone book application by enabling users to edit person details, improving the overall user experience and data management capabilities.

## Editing a Person

In this section, we will focus on adding the ability to edit a person in the phone book application. We will make changes to the application service, generate the service proxies, and update the component script accordingly.

### Application Service

To enable editing functionality, we need to add a `EditPerson` method to the server-side `IPersonAppService`. We'll define the method as follows:

```csharp
Task EditPerson(EditPersonInput input);
```

Additionally, we need to create a DTO (Data Transfer Object) to transfer the person's `Id`, `Name`, `Surname`, and `EmailAddress`. Let's define the `EditPersonInput` DTO:

```csharp
public class EditPersonInput: EntityDto
{
    public string Name {get;set;}
    public string Surname {get;set;}
    public string EmailAddress {get;set;}
}
```

The `EntityDto` is a convenient shortcut provided by ABP (ASP.NET Boilerplate) when we only need to transfer an `Id` value.

The implementation of the `EditPerson` method in the PersonAppService is straightforward. We retrieve the person entity based on the provided `Id` and update its properties with the values from the input DTO. Finally, we save the changes using the `_personRepository`. Here's the implementation:

```csharp
public async Task EditPerson(EditPersonInput input)
{
    var person = await _personRepository.GetAsync(input.Id);
    if (input.Name != null)
    {
        person.Name = input.Name;
    }

    if (input.Surname != null)
    {
        person.Surname = input.Surname;
    }

    if (input.EmailAddress != null)
    {
        person.EmailAddress = input.EmailAddress;
    }

    await _personRepository.UpdateAsync(person);
}
```

### Service Proxy Generation

Since we have made changes to the server-side services, it is important to regenerate the client-side service proxies using **NSwag**. Ensure that the server-side application is running, and then run the `userefresh.bat` script, as explained in the previous parts of this series. 

### Component Script

To incorporate the update functionality into the phone book component, we need to make changes to the `phonebook.component.ts` file.

First, import the necessary dependencies and update the `PhoneBookComponent` class definition as follows:

```typescript
import {Component, Injector} from '@angular/core';
import {AppComponentBase} from '@shared/common/app-component-base';
import {appModuleAnimation} from '@shared/animations/routerTransition';
import {EditPersonInput, PersonServiceProxy} from "@shared/service-proxies/service-proxies";
import CustomStore from "@node_modules/devextreme/data/custom_store";

@Component({
    templateUrl: './phonebook.component.html',
    animations: [appModuleAnimation()]
})

export class PhoneBookComponent extends AppComponentBase {

    dataSource: any;
    refreshMode: string;

    constructor(
        injector: Injector,
        private _personService: PersonServiceProxy
    ) {
        super(injector);
        this.getData();
    }

    getData() {
        this.refreshMode = "full";

        this.dataSource = new CustomStore({
            key: "id",
            load: (loadOptions) => {
                return this._personService.getPeople("").toPromise();
            },
            insert: (values) => {
                return this._personService.createPerson(values).toPromise()
            },
            update: (key, values) => {
                return this._personService.editPerson(new EditPersonInput({
                    id: key,
                    name: values.name,
                    emailAddress: values.emailAddress,
                    surname: values.surname
                })).toPromise();
            },
            remove: (key) => {
                return this._personService.deletePerson(key).toPromise();
            }
        });
    }
}

```

Go to `phonebook.component.html` and add `dxo-editing` tag with `allowUpdating` true option:

```html
<div [@routerTransition]>
    <div class="content d-flex flex-column flex-column-fluid">
        <sub-header [title]="'PhoneBook' | localize">
        </sub-header>

        <div [class]="containerClass">
            <div class="card card-custom">
                <div class="card-body">
                    <dx-data-grid
                        id="phonebookgrid"
                        [dataSource]="dataSource"
                        [repaintChangesOnly]="true"
                        [showBorders]="true">

                        <dxo-scrolling mode="virtual"></dxo-scrolling>
                        <dxo-editing
                            mode="row"
                            [refreshMode]="refreshMode"
                            [allowAdding]="true"
                            [allowUpdating]="true"
                            [allowDeleting]="true">
                        </dxo-editing>

                        <dxi-column dataField="name" caption="{{'Name' | localize}}"></dxi-column>
                        <dxi-column dataField="surname" caption="{{'Surname' | localize}}"></dxi-column>
                        <dxi-column dataField="emailAddress" caption="{{'EmailAddress' | localize}}"></dxi-column>
                    </dx-data-grid>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

```

It first shows a confirmation message when we click the edit  button:

<img src="/Images/Blog/phonebook-edit-person-view-1.png" alt="Confirmation message" class="img-thumbnail" />

<img src="/Images/Blog/phonebook-edit-person-view-2.png" alt="Confirmation message" class="img-thumbnail" />

## Multi Tenancy

We have built a fully functional application until here. Now, we will see how to **convert** it to a **multi-tenant** application easily. **Logout** from the application before any change.

### Enable Multi Tenancy

We disabled multi-tenancy at the beginning of this document. Now, **re-enabling** it in `PhoneBookDemoConsts` class:

```csharp
public const bool MultiTenancyEnabled = true;
```

### Make Entities Multi Tenant

In a multi-tenant application, a tenant's entities should be **isolated** by other tenants. For this example project, every tenant **should** have own phone book with isolated people and phone numbers.

When we implement `IMustHaveTenant` interface, ABP automatically [filters data](https://aspnetboilerplate.com/Pages/Documents/Data-Filters) based on current Tenant, while retrieving entities from database. So, we should declare that Person entity must have a tenant using `IMustHaveTenant` interface:

```csharp
public class Person : FullAuditedEntity, IMustHaveTenant
{
    public virtual int TenantId { get; set; }

    //...other properties
}
```

We may want to add `IMustHaveTenant` interface to also `Phone` entity. This is needed if we directly use phone repository to get phones.In this sample project, it's not needed.

Since entities have changed, we should create a new database migration:

```
Add-Migration "Implemented_IMustHaveTenant_For_Person"
```

This command creates a new code-first database migration. The migration class adds an annotation this is needed for automatic filtering. We don't have to know what it is since it's done automatically. It also adds a `TenantId` column to `PbPersons` table as shown below:

```csharp
migrationBuilder.AddColumn<int>(name: "TenantId",table: "PbPersons",nullable: false,defaultValue: 1);
```

I added **defaultValue as 1** to `AddColumn` options. Thus, current people are automatically assigned to **default tenant** (default tenant's id is always 1).

Now, we can update the database again:

```
Update-Database
```

## Running the Application

**It's finished**! We can test the application. Run the project, **login** as the **host admin** (click Change link and clear  tenancy name) shown below:

<img src="/Images/Blog/login-as-host-7.png" alt="Login as host" class="img-thumbnail" style="width:100.0%" />

Default **admin** password is **123qwe**. After login, we see the **tenant list** which only contains a **default** tenant. We can create a new tenant:

<img src="/Images/Blog/create-tenant-6.png" alt="Creating tenant" class="img-thumbnail" />

I created a new tenant named **trio**. Now, tenant list has two tenants:

<img src="/Images/Blog/tenant-management-phonebook-2.png" alt="Tenant management page" class="img-thumbnail" style="width:100.0%" />

I can **logout** and login as **trio** tenant **admin** (Change current tenant to trio):

<img src="/Images/Blog/login-as-trio1.png" alt="Login as tenant admin" class="img-thumbnail" style="width:100.0%" />

After login, we see that phone book is empty:

<img src="/Images/Blog/phonebook-empty1.png" alt="Empty phonebook of new tenant" class="img-thumbnail" />

It's empty because **trio** tenant has a completely **isolated** people list. You can add people here, logout and login as different tenants (you can login as default tenant for example). You will see that each tenant has an isolated phone book and can not see other's people.

## Conclusion

In this blog post series, we have explored the integration of **ASP.NET Zero** with **DevExtreme** Angular, showcasing the **implementation** of various features in the phone book application. We started by adding the necessary **server-side** methods and DTOs for editing a person's information. Then, we regenerated the **client-side** service proxies to ensure seamless communication between the Angular application and the ASP.NET Zero backend.

ASP.NET Zero empowers developers to build **sophisticated** web applications by providing a **solid architectural** foundation and **flexibility** for customization. The **integration** with DevExtreme Angular further enhances the user interface and improves the overall user experience.

We hope this blog post series has been insightful and helpful in understanding the **integration of ASP.NET Zero with DevExtreme Angular**. By leveraging these **powerful frameworks**, you can create **feature-rich** applications with ease.
